## 🧭 Overview

The **Indian Farmer Crop Recommendation System** (v1.0) is a full-stack intelligent advisory platform built to help farmers across India make data-driven decisions about which crops to grow. It combines **real-time weather data**, **district-level historical weather records** (~40,180 records spanning 10+ years for 640+ districts across 34 states), **ML-powered forecasting** (LSTM + XGBoost ensemble trained on real district data), **crop suitability prediction** (Random Forest), **risk assessment**, **pest warnings**, **planting calendar**, and now a **Gemini LLM layer** that filters geographically inappropriate crops and generates farmer-friendly AI explanations — all accessible through a clean web UI and a RESTful API.

Farmers interact through a **bilingual Hindi/English web interface**, while developers can access all features via a **FastAPI REST API** with Swagger documentation.

## ✨ Features

### 🗺️ Nationwide Regional Coverage
- **All 640 Indian Agricultural Districts** across 34 states and union territories
- Region IDs follow `<STATE_CODE>_<DISTRICT>` format (e.g., `MH_PUNE`, `UP_LUCKNOW`, `PB_LUDHIANA`)
- Each region includes geographic coordinates, elevation, climate zone, soil type, and supported seasons
- **Full agro-climatic zone coverage**: every region now receives a zone-based suitability score (0.75) — eliminating the prior 552-region gap where the 0.50 fallback was used
- **Haversine-based nearest region finder** (150 km radius) for GPS coordinate-based lookups

### 🌦️ Weather & Historical Climate Data
- Real-time weather fetched from **[Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com/)** — no API key needed
- **District-level historical weather data** for 640+ districts across 34 states, fetched via `fetch_district_weather.py`
- **Zone-level historical climate normals** (monthly averages for 6 zones: North, South, East, West, Central, Northeast)
- Medium-range **17–90 day agricultural forecast** including temperature, rainfall, dry-spell risk, and humidity
- Month-wise (Jan–Dec) climate chart on the web interface with current-month highlighting

### 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- **LSTM Weather Forecasting** — PyTorch-based LSTM trained on 640+ districts with 30-day lookback window; forecasts temperature and rainfall 7 days ahead
- **XGBoost Weather Forecasting** — Gradient-boosted trees with lag features, rolling statistics, and district encoding across 640+ districts; separate models for `temp_max`, `temp_min`, and `rainfall`
- **Ensemble forecasting** — LSTM and XGBoost predictions are blended; graceful fallback to zone climatology if district data is unavailable
- **Crop Suitability** — Random Forest model blending rule-based scores with data-driven predictions
- **ML score blending** — when models are trained, their predictions are automatically weighted with the rule-based engine

### 🧠 Gemini LLM Integration
A two-layer AI pipeline powered by **Google Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash-lite`)** is applied after the ML scoring stage:

#### 🔍 Regional Crop Filter (`llm_filter.py`)
- Sends the ML-ranked crop shortlist to Gemini along with district name, state code, agro-climatic zone hint, and season
- LLM removes geographically inappropriate crops (e.g., Baby Corn in Nanded, Apple in MP) before the final ranking is returned
- Falls back gracefully to the unfiltered ML list if Gemini is unavailable or returns an empty result
- Optimized for **free-tier quota**: compact prompts with state-zone pre-baked context

#### 💬 Farmer-Friendly Explainer (`llm_explainer.py`)
- Generates 2-sentence AI explanations for the **top 3 recommended crops** in English, Hindi, or Marathi depending on the state
- Each explanation includes: `english` reason, `why_good` (best feature in <10 words), `watch_out` (key tip in <12 words), and an optional regional language field
- The `/recommend` response includes `"llm_powered": true` and `"llm_note"` when explanations are active

> **Note**: Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env` to enable LLM features. The system works fully without it — all LLM steps fall back gracefully.

### 🌱 Comprehensive Crop Database
- **50+ Short-Duration Crops** (15–90 days):
  - **Millets**: Bajra, Jowar, Ragi, Foxtail Millet
  - **Pulses**: Moong, Urad, Cowpea, Guar
  - **Oilseeds**: Sesame, Sunflower, Soybean
  - **Vegetables**: Tomato, Brinjal, Okra, Bottle Gourd, Cucumber, Ridge Gourd, Bitter Gourd, Carrot, Radish, Beetroot, Turnip, French Beans, Cluster Beans, Spring Onion
  - **Leafy Greens**: Spinach, Fenugreek (Methi), Coriander (Dhaniya), Amaranth, Mustard Greens, Lettuce
  - *…and many more*
- Per-crop metadata: temperature range, water requirements, drought tolerance, soil needs, zone/regional suitability, seasonal suitability, yield estimates, market demand, growing tips, and recommended varieties

### 🧪 Intelligent Scoring Engine
Multi-factor **suitability score (0–100)** calculated across 6 dimensions:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Temperature Compatibility | 25% |
| Water Availability | 25% |
| Soil Compatibility | 15% |
| Regional Suitability | 15% |
| Seasonal Adjustment | 10% |
| Drought Tolerance | 10% |

### 🛡️ Risk Assessment Engine
- Evaluates **drought risk**, **temperature stress**, and **extreme weather events**
- Per-crop risk scoring using weather forecast + crop thresholds
- Integrated into `/recommend` response and available standalone via `/risk-assessment`

### 🐛 Pest & Disease Warning System
- Weather-triggered pest and disease warnings
- Region and crop-specific warnings based on current conditions
- Returns top 3 most likely threats per crop in the recommendation

### 📅 Planting Calendar
- Season-aware milestone dates: sowing → germination → flowering → harvest
- Per-phase care tips for each crop
- Available standalone via `/planting-calendar/{crop_id}`

### 🌿 Soil Compatibility Analysis
- Soil model with texture, pH, organic matter, and drainage
- Automated amendment suggestions: pH adjustments (lime/sulfur), texture improvements, drainage fixes
- Default soil profiles for all regions

### 📅 Season-Aware Logic
- **Automatic season detection**: Kharif (Jun–Sep), Rabi (Oct–Feb), Zaid (Mar–May)
- Season transition handling within a **30-day threshold**
- Seasonal water adjustments: Kharif −15% (monsoon benefit), Rabi −5%, Zaid +10%

### 🌐 Web Interface
- **Bilingual UI** (Hindi + English) — accessible and farmer-friendly
- Visual suitability score bars (🟢 High / 🟠 Medium / 🔴 Low)
- Month-wise weather forecast chart (Jan–Dec)
- Color-coded **risk level badges** and pest warnings per crop
- Mobile-responsive design — no login required

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python **3.8+**
- pip
- A free **[Google Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)** *(optional — enables LLM features)*

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tirthch25/Indian-Farmer-Crop-Recommendation-System.git
cd Indian-Farmer-Crop-Recommendation-System/agri_crop_recommendation
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file inside `agri_crop_recommendation/` with your Gemini API key:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

> **Without a key**: the system runs fully in ML-only mode. LLM regional filtering and AI explanations are silently skipped, and all other features work normally.

### 5. (Optional) Fetch District-Level Weather Data
```bash
python scripts/fetch_district_weather.py
```
> Downloads historical weather data for 640+ districts from the Open-Meteo API. Required for district-aware LSTM and XGBoost model training. This step takes time due to API rate limits.

### 6. (Optional) Train the Weather & Crop Suitability Models
```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```
> Trains the **LSTM** (PyTorch) and **XGBoost** weather forecasting models on district data, and trains the **Random Forest** crop suitability model. All models fall back gracefully to climatology / rule-based scoring if not present.

### 7. Start the Web Server
```bash
python run_website.py
```

### 8. Open in Your Browser
```

http://localhost:8000/docs     ← Swagger API Docs
